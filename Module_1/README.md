AI-Driven Precision Irrigation and Pest Mitigation System - Bayesian Pest Risk BN

This mini-project provides:
- A compact Bayesian Network implementation that estimates pest outbreak risk (Low/Medium/High)
  given evidence: Humidity, NDVI, PheromoneCount, CropMaturity.
- Exact inference for posterior P(PestOutbreak | evidence).
- A Bayes-Ball d-separation check.

Run:
1) python3 src/inference.py

Python 3.8+ recommended.
