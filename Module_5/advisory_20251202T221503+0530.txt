**Farmer Advisory Note**

**Urgency Level: High**  
**Affected Plots: 12, 27**  

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Irrigation:**
   - **Plot 12:**
     - Action: Use the AGV to irrigate.
     - Volume: 70 liters.
     - Timing: Start immediately and complete within 22 minutes.
   - **Plot 27:**
     - Action: Use the AGV to irrigate.
     - Volume: 70 liters.
     - Timing: Start immediately and complete within 22 minutes.

2. **Pesticide Application:**
   - **Plot 12:**
     - Action: Apply pesticide using a drone.
     - Estimated Drone Trips: 1.
     - Safety Wait: 30 minutes after application before entering the plot.
   - **Plot 27:**
     - Action: Apply pesticide using a drone.
     - Estimated Drone Trips: 1.
     - Safety Wait: 30 minutes after application before entering the plot.

**Materials/Tools Needed:**
- AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle)
- Drone for pesticide application
- 140 liters of water (70 liters per plot)
- Pesticide (ensure it is suitable for the crops)

**Safety and Regulatory Warnings:**
- Always wear protective gear when handling pesticides.
- Follow local regulations regarding pesticide application.
- Ensure no people or pets are in the area during pesticide application.

**Rationale for Recommended Actions:**
- **Heatwave Impact:** The upcoming heatwave can stress plants, making them more susceptible to pests and diseases.
- **Water Quota Reduction:** With a 30% reduction in water availability, it’s crucial to use water efficiently to keep the crops hydrated.
- **Immediate Risk:** Plots 12 and 27 are at immediate risk; prompt action is necessary to protect your crops.

Please act quickly to implement these recommendations to safeguard your crops during the heatwave.
