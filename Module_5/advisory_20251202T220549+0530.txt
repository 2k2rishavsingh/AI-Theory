**Farmer Advisory Note**

**Urgency Level: High**  
**Affected Plots: 12, 27**  

**Immediate Actions Needed:**

1. **Irrigation:**
   - **Plot 12:**
     - Action: Water the plot.
     - Volume: Use 140 liters.
     - Timing: Start irrigation immediately.
   - **Plot 27:**
     - Action: Water the plot.
     - Volume: Use 140 liters.
     - Timing: Start irrigation immediately.

2. **Pesticide Application:**
   - **Plot 12:**
     - Action: Apply pesticide to control pests.
     - Drone Trip Estimate: 1 trip.
     - Safety Wait: 30 minutes after application before entering the plot.
   - **Plot 27:**
     - Action: Apply pesticide to control pests.
     - Drone Trip Estimate: 1 trip.
     - Safety Wait: 30 minutes after application before entering the plot.

**Materials/Tools Needed:**
- Water source (for irrigation)
- Drone for pesticide application
- Pesticide (ensure it is suitable for the pests you are targeting)
- Personal protective equipment (gloves, mask)

**Safety and Regulatory Warnings:**
- Always wear protective gear when handling pesticides.
- Follow local regulations regarding pesticide use and application.

**Rationale for Recommended Actions:**
- **Heatwave Impact:** The upcoming heatwave will increase water evaporation and stress plants, making immediate irrigation crucial.
- **Pest Control:** High temperatures can lead to pest outbreaks; applying pesticide now will help protect your crops.
- **Water Quota:** With a 30% reduction in water quota, it’s essential to use water efficiently; focus on the most affected plots first.

**Step-by-Step Guidance:**
1. Prepare your water source and ensure it is ready for use.
2. Use your AGV to transport water to plots 12 and 27.
3. For each plot, use 1 nozzle and walk at a speed of 3 km/h to apply water evenly.
4. After irrigation, set up the drone for pesticide application.
5. Monitor the drone’s battery and ensure it can complete the trip (22 minutes max).
6. Wait 30 minutes after pesticide application before entering the plots.
