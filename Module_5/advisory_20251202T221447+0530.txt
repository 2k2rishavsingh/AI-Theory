**Farmer Advisory Note**

**Urgency Level: High**

**Affected Plots: 12, 27**

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Irrigation:**
   - **Plot 12:**
     - Action: Use the AGV to irrigate.
     - Volume: 140 liters.
     - Timing: Start immediately and irrigate for 30 minutes.
   - **Plot 27:**
     - Action: Use the AGV to irrigate.
     - Volume: 140 liters.
     - Timing: Start immediately and irrigate for 30 minutes.

2. **Pesticide Application:**
   - **Plot 12:**
     - Action: Apply pesticide using the drone.
     - Drone Trip Estimate: 1 trip.
     - Safety Wait: 30 minutes before re-entering the plot.
   - **Plot 27:**
     - Action: Apply pesticide using the drone.
     - Drone Trip Estimate: 1 trip.
     - Safety Wait: 30 minutes before re-entering the plot.

**Materials/Tools Needed:**
- AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle)
- Drone for pesticide application
- Pesticide (ensure it is suitable for your crops)
- Water source for irrigation

**Safety and Regulatory Warnings:**
- Always wear gloves and a mask when handling pesticides.
- Follow local regulations regarding pesticide application.
- Ensure no people or pets are in the area during pesticide spraying.

**Rationale for Recommended Actions:**
- **Heatwave Impact:** The upcoming heatwave will increase water evaporation and stress plants, making immediate irrigation crucial.
- **Pest Control:** High temperatures can lead to pest outbreaks; applying pesticide now will protect your crops.
- **Water Quota:** With a 30% reduction in water quota, it’s essential to use water efficiently and prioritize the most affected plots.

Please act quickly to protect your crops!
