**Farmer Advisory Note**

**Urgency Level: High**  
**Affected Plots: 12, 27**  

**Immediate Actions Required:**

1. **Irrigation:**
   - **Plot 12:**
     - Action: Water the plot.
     - Volume: Use 105 liters.
     - Timing: Start irrigation immediately.
   - **Plot 27:**
     - Action: Water the plot.
     - Volume: Use 105 liters.
     - Timing: Start irrigation immediately.

2. **Pesticide Application:**
   - **Plot 12:**
     - Action: Apply pesticide to control pests.
     - Drone Trip Estimate: 1 trip.
     - Safety Wait: 30 minutes after application before entering the area.
   - **Plot 27:**
     - Action: Apply pesticide to control pests.
     - Drone Trip Estimate: 1 trip.
     - Safety Wait: 30 minutes after application before entering the area.

**Materials/Tools Needed:**
- Water source (for irrigation)
- Drone for pesticide application
- Pesticide (ensure it is suitable for your crops)
- Safety gear (gloves, mask)

**Safety and Regulatory Warnings:**
- Always wear safety gear when handling pesticides.
- Follow local regulations regarding pesticide use.
- Ensure that the pesticide is safe for the crops you are treating.

**Rationale for Recommended Actions:**
- **Heatwave Impact:** The upcoming heatwave will increase water evaporation, making immediate irrigation crucial to prevent crop stress.
- **Pest Control:** High temperatures can lead to increased pest activity; applying pesticide now will help protect your crops.
- **Water Quota:** With a 30% reduction in water quota, it’s essential to use water efficiently. The recommended volumes are calculated to maximize coverage while adhering to the quota.

Please act quickly to protect your crops!
